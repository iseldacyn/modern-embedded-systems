# Quantum Leaps Modern Embedded Systems

My projects and notes from the Modern Embedded Systems Programming course by Quantum Leaps. The playlist for this course may be found [here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPW8O6W-1chwyTzI3BHwBLbGQoPFxPAPM&si=BWT0-DhhVAY5DNPo).

I am using the [Stellaris (TivaC) Launchpad](https://www.ti.com/tool/EK-TM4C123GXL) alongside Keil uVision IDE for each lecture, and documenting notable information as comments in each main file.
